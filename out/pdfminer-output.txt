I  am  an  easy-going,  quick  learner  specialising  in  machine  learning  and  artificial 
intelligence.  I  am  honed  in  software  development  and  have  strong  foundations  in 
hardware-aware design. I am well-versed in interdisciplinary applications of AI and have 
academic  and  industrial  experience  in  multiple  sub-branches  of  ML.  I  am  eager  for  a 
challenge in a role that offers opportunities for growth as an ML/AI engineer.
